git add
To add new files, you need to go to the directory and enter git add .
This will add all files except the ones that contain .gitignore
Alternatively you can use git add filename/pattern
Only add files to the next commit you make.
If you modify the file after adding but before committing, you should add again.
This will ignore the first modified version.
