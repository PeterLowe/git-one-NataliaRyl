git add
To add new files, you need to go to the directory and enter git add .
This will add all files except the ones that contain .gitignore
Alternatively you can use git add filename/pattern
Only add files to the next commit you make.
If you modify the file after adding but before committing, you should add again.
This will ignore the first modified version.

git status
This lists all the files in the directory.
This includes the modified files in the working area; the added files in the staging area; and the current branch.

git commit
This allows the current node to be joined with the new node.
They can be thought of as snapshots of a Git project.
They are created to capture the state of a project at that point in time.

git init
This creates a new Git repository.
It can also re-initiate a previous repository.

git push
This updates the remote node with the current node.
It pushes the files from the staging area to the master branch.
